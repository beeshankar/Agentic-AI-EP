# Frontend
This directory contains the frontend application, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Functionality
-   **User Interface**: Provides the interactive user interface for the application.
-   **LLM Interaction**: Communicates with the backend services to send requests to and display responses from the LLMs.
-   **Component-based Architecture**: Utilizes React components for modular and reusable UI elements.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (18 or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash

    ```

### Running the Application
